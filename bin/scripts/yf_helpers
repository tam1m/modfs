# summarize some often needed helper (shell) functions, which provide replacements    #
# of missing features in the very limited environment of FRITZ!OS with only a small   #
# selection of busybox applets and without many "generally available" commands like   #
# "awk" or "od" and so on ...                                                         #
#                                                                                     #
# Surely some functions may be implemented in a more effective manner ... but the     #
# purpose of this file is to provide a very basic implementation of such functions    #
# with as few dependencies as possible and the normal shell in a busybox-based        #
# environment is "ash", which has limited capabilities too.                           #
#                                                                                     #
# If possible, additional attention was paid to make the functions POSIX compatible   #
# so they may be used from a more limited shell like 'dash'.                          #
#                                                                                     #
# If nothing else is mentioned for a function, it's designed to run from any platform #
# supporting BusyBox - it should be possible to use these functions from MIPS, ARMv6  #
# (Puma6), ARMv7 (Raspberry Pi) and x86 (Puma6/x86).                                  #
